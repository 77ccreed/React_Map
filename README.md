# Udacity FEND Project #8: Local diner - Neighbourhood Map App
This is the last project in the nine month course. I started with a complete beginner. Now i can
read and write JavaScript. I've learned React for a month.
The pace of learning has been quick.
All this has become possible just thanks to Google, Udacity, kindly mentors and friendly fellow students. In the context of this project, I would like to thank, in particular:
