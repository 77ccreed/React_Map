# Udacity FEND Project #8: Local diner - Neighbourhood Map App
This is the last project in the nine month course. I started as a complete beginner. Now i can
read and write JavaScript. I've learned React for a 2 month now.
The pace of learning has been quick.
All this has become possible just thanks to Google, Udacity, kindly mentors and friendly fellow students. In the context of this project, I would like to thank, in particular:

I follow 300+ Udacity students in GitHub. It's helpful when You see how others do their projects.
